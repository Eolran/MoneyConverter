# Welcome to the Money-Value Project !

## Start this project.
To start this project, you'll need to open two or more commands prompts (for your convenience.) As you will need to open the back-end server for the project, and the front application.

This project is developped in Vue3 + Larave 10, to run this project, you will need a admin panel like MAMPP or XAMPP to help you start this project without difficulties. You should start by the application back-end to avoid errors with the generation of data.

As it, start by opening two commands prompts, and in each one, write:

```cd moneyvalue-back```

```cd moneyvalue-front```

And let's proceed to the proper Readme.md inside thoses two new folders.

## Roadmap
1. Add more style to the existant pages.
2. Secure the administrators requests.
3. Add the form to create a currency from the front-end
4. Add th counter to see each time a conversion pair is used
