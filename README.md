# Welcome to the Money-Value Project !

## Start this project.
To start this project, you'll need to open two or more commands prompts (for your convenience.) As you will need to open the back-end server for the project, and the front application.

As it, start by opening two commands prompts, and in each one, write:

```cd moneyvalue-back```

```code cd moneyvalue-front```

And let's proceed to the proper Readme.md inside thoses two new folders.

## Roadmap
1. Add more style to the existant pages.
2. Secure the administrators requests.
